      <p> On the top left of the picture you see Avery Grambs, the main character of the trilogy. In the middle you can see Libby, who is the sister of Avery. You can also see the four Hawthorne brothers; Xander, Jameson, Nash and Grayson. Jameson and Grayson are the brothers who are mentioned the most in the book. I think you can also consider them main characters. Then the other girls in the picture; Rebecca and Emily are sisters and they have a very complicated relationship with the Hawthorne family. Max is Avery's best friend and Thea is a girl from the new school that Avery attends. </p>
      <p>All of the characters are very complicated and have very different personalities for example: Jameson is a character that jokes alot and is very curious but can also be very serious while Grayson is a very serious character that doesn't joke alot. Avery is portrayed as a very nervous character. That obviously also has something to do with the things that she's going through. </p>
      <p> Rebecca is a very quiet character that isn't mentoined that much in the book and when she is mentoined she doesn't talk alot but she is a very important character to the story. Thea isn't really a nice person, she is pretty mean to Avery sometimes.
